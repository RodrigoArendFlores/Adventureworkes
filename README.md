# Project Adventureworks
This repository is a part of the Indicium's Analytics Engineering Course of 2021 Final Challenge.

In this course was necessary to do the complete data process, from extraction to visualization.

The pipeline de EL (extract-load) was carried out with Stitch and the DW tool used was GCP(Google Cloud Platform) with the Data Build Tool DBT.

In repository you will find the DBT code used in the project that I mentioned above.
